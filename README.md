# TweetSaver
This program gets a twitter id and displays twitter's tweet or it saves the tweets into a JSON file named twitter's id. 
It parses through twitter's HTML code using the Html-request library.
It saves the twitters id, date, and content of the tweet and the date which file created/updated.
It will overwrite the previous file if a file with the twitters id already exists and updates the date on top of the file.
